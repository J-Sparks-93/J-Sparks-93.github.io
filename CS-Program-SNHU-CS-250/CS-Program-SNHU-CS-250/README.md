As I traversed this course, I've learned to ask why multiple times, this will help get to the root of a user issue, and ultimately the root issue to be solved by the development teams. Being present and involved ensures you build a good rapport with your teammates, and allows you to express what you need to about any issues or hiccups that you're encountering along the development process. This open communication and the reasonable expectation that things will change, gives an agile developer the unique advantage of adding mutliple points of view from the team, to create a more cohesive product that otherwise may not have been created.
